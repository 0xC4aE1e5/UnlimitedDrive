    <h1>Crazy cheap storage</h1>
    <p>
      Need to take your files on the go? Have limited money? Use UnlimitedDrive.
      Just buy a very cheap flash drive (in the small gigabytes or big megabytes
      numbers, don't get into the terabytes, it's a scam), then drag and drop
      this file, and that's it. It's also recommended to install uBlock Origin
      into your web browser to avoid getting scammed when downloading your
      files.
    </p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
      First, you drag and drop all of your files, and right click Sync.ps1 and
      run with PowerShell. It will then convert all of your files to links to a
      file sharing site that has unlimited storage (nobody else will see it,
      unless they brute-force a link to your file, which is unlikely). To open a
      file, just open the file and click DOWNLOAD. To reupload the file, just
      drag and drop it in the same folder as the link and run Sync.ps1 again. It
      won't reupload the links.
    </p>
    <h2>Download</h2>
    <p>
      OK, you want to download it, I understand. Just format a USB drive,
      download and copy this file (you may have to right click and save link
      as):
    </p>
    <a href="Code/Sync.ps1" download>Sync.ps1</a>
